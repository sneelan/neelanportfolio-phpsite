          I got this Project from IBrand Marketing Solution (Chennai)company. They wanted to
          create an app for Providing quality service to their potential customers in the Real-estate industry.
          <br><b>Here’s how a CRM system can help their business</b>
          <br>
          Introducing a CRM platform has been shown to produce real results – including direct improvements to the
           bottom line. CRM applications have a proven track record of increasing: LEAD CONVERSION, SALES,
           PRODUCTIVITY, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, FASTER DECISION-MAKING,&nbsp;REVENUE. By understanding your customers
            better, cross-selling and upselling opportunities become clear — giving you the chance to win new
             business from existing customers.Todays customers expect fast, personalized support, at any time
              of day or night. A CRM system can help you provide the high-quality service that customers are
               looking for. Your agents can quickly see what products customers have ordered, and they can
               get a record of every interaction so they can give customers the answers they need, fast.

               I got this project offer from Chennai client <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheik-abdulla-2847567/">

            I searched for this kind of CRM app, but I found that many apps are available with expensive monthly charges for using their software. So I researched well and tried to find a customized solution for their business need and I included some new features like auto WhatsApp message integration,&nbsp;Automatic SMS email notification, Chat features, and Instant Call connection through Intercom Phone.&nbsp; So, in this case, scenario, I was eager to design a product where a company collects potential customers contact information from third-party websites, then provide solution based on their interest and financial budget.&nbsp;

          I am able to draw user flow and wireframes that I could make sure that I am taking care of users
          and companies pain points.
          So that I could give a more user-centered prototype, below are the final user flow and
            wireframes:

            the user journey more meaningful. Below is the wireframe that I finalized:

          from the app, and to get the minimum information we need from the user in order to get started.
            I did this by showing a simple walkthrough and used forms that are as frictionless as
            possible with no need to type.

          I learned and discovered something new at every stage of the process.
          From finding out the problem and validating it to conducting user research,
          preparing wireframes based on the identified user needs, and developing the UI for the app —
          the entire process has been highly rewarding.The outcome of all the long hours spent trying to
          develop a minimal and easy-to-use app led to a potential solution that feels like it was always
           meant to be there.
